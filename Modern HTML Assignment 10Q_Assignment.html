                        <li>Markup Language: HTML is a markup language that uses tags to define the structure and content of web pages. These tags tell web browsers how to display the content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.</li>
                    </ol>

                <td><ol type="1"> <li>Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like < header >, < footer >, < nav >, < article >, < section >, and < main >, which provide a clearer structure to web documents, making them more understandable for both humans and machines. These elements improve accessibility, search engine optimization, and document structure.</li></ol></td>

                        <li>Text-based Format: HTML documents are text-based files that can be created and edited using simple text editors. Each HTML element is represented by an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, enclosed within angle brackets (< >). For example, < p > represents a paragraph element.</li>

                        <li>Audio and Video Support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the < audio > and < video > elements, reducing reliance on third-party plugins like Flash. This enables developers to easily integrate multimedia content into webpages without the need for additional plugins or dependencies.</li>

                        <li>Hyperlinks: HTML allows the creation of hyperlinks using the < a > (anchor) element, which enables users to navigate between web pages by clicking on text or images. Hyperlinks are fundamental for navigating the interconnected nature of the web.</li>
