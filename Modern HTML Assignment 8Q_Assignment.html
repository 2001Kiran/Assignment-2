    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring webpages on the World Wide Web. It provides a set of elements or tags that define the structure and content of a webpage, including text, images, links, multimedia, and interactive elements. HTML is the backbone of web development, serving as the foundation for building and displaying content in web browsers.
    </p><br>br
    <p>HTML documents consist of a series of elements enclosed in tags, which are interpreted by web browsers to render the content on the screen. Each HTML element serves a specific purpose and can contain attributes that provide additional information or functionality. For example, the < h1 > element represents a top-level heading, while the < p > element represents a paragraph of text.</p><br>
    <p>HTML is often combined with other technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to webpages. Together, these technologies form the basis of modern web development, enabling the creation of rich, interactive, and visually appealing websites and web applications.</p><br>
    <p>HTML has evolved over time, with newer versions introducing additional features, enhancements, and improvements to meet the evolving needs and demands of web development. The latest version, HTML5, includes support for multimedia, graphics, semantic markup, offline web applications, and more, making it a powerful and versatile tool for building modern web experiences.</p><br>
