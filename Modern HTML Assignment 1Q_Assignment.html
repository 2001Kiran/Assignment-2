    <h3>The Features of the HTML5: </h3>
    HTML5, the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web, introduces several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here are some key features of HTML5:

    <ol type="1">
        <li><u><b>Semantics:</b></u> HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like < header >, < footer >, < nav >, < article >, < section >, etc., which provide a clearer structure to web documents, making them more understandable for both humans and machines.</li>
       <br> <li><u><b>Audio and Video Support: </b></u>HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the < audio > and < video > elements, reducing the reliance on third-party plugins like Flash.</li>
        <br><li><u><b>Canvas: </b></u>The < canvas > element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images, enabling the creation of interactive graphics, animations, and games directly within the browser without the need for plugins.</li>
       <br> <li><u><b>Offline Web Applications: </b></u>HTML5 introduces technologies like the Application Cache (AppCache) and Web Storage (localStorage and sessionStorage), enabling web applications to work offline and store data locally, providing a better user experience.</li>
       <br> <li><u><b>Geolocation: </b></u>HTML5 provides native support for retrieving a user's geographical location through the Geolocation API, enabling location-aware web applications.      </li>
      <br>  <li><u><b>Drag and Drop:</b></u>HTML5 introduces native support for drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to drag elements and drop them onto designated areas on a web page without the need for external libraries or plugins.       </li>
      <br>  <li><u><b>Form Controls: </b></u>HTML5 enhances form capabilities with new input types (< input type="date" >, < input type="email" >, < input type="url" >, etc.), attributes (required, autocomplete, pattern, etc.), and form validation, improving user experience and accessibility.   </li>
       <br>
        <li><u><b>Web Workers: </b></u>HTML5 introduces the Web Workers API, which allows scripts to run in the background independently of the main page, enabling multitasking and improved performance in web applications.       </li>
    </ol>
<p>These are just some of the key features that HTML5 brings to web development, helping to create richer, more interactive, and more accessible web experiences.</p>
