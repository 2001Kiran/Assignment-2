    <h3>Web accessibility: </h3>
    <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that ensures equal access to all users, including those with disabilities or impairments.</p>
    <p>Here are some key aspects of web accessibility: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Perceivability: Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content (such as images or multimedia), ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors, and making sure that content is easily distinguishable and readable.</li><br>
        <li>Operability: User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that users should be able to interact with all interactive elements using various input methods, such as keyboard, mouse, or touch. Additionally, any time limits on content should be adjustable or removable to accommodate users who may need more time to navigate or interact with content.</li><br>
        <li>Understandability: Content and navigation should be understandable. Users should be able to easily understand the information presented and how to navigate through the website or application. This includes providing clear and consistent navigation, using predictable behavior for interactive elements, and ensuring that form controls and error messages are clearly labeled and easy to understand.</li><br>
        <li>Robustness: Content must be robust enough to work with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and speech recognition software. This involves using valid and semantic HTML markup, providing alternative text for multimedia content, and ensuring compatibility with accessibility features built into web browsers and operating systems.  </li><br>
        
    </ul>
<p>These are just a few examples of assistive devices that play a significant role in providing accessibility to individuals with disabilities, empowering them to participate more fully in digital and technological environments.</p>
